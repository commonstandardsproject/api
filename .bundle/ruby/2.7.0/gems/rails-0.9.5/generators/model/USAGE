GENERATOR
     model - create model stub files

SYNOPSIS
     generate model ModelName

DESCRIPTION
     The model generator takes a model name and generates an empty model in
     app/models, a test suite in test/unit with one passing test case, and a
     fixtures YAML file in the test/fixtures directory.

EXAMPLE
     ./script/generate model Account

     This will generate an Account class in app/models/account.rb, an
     AccountTest in test/unit/account_test.rb, and the fixtures file
     test/fixtures/account.yml.
