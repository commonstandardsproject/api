# cgi/session/memcached.rb - persistent storage of marshalled session data
#
# == Overview
#
# This file provides the CGI::Session::MemCache class, which builds
# persistence of storage data on top of the MemCache library.  See
# cgi/session.rb for more details on session storage managers.

        #      session cache.
