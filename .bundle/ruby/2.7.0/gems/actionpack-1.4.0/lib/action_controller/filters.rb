    # Filters enable controllers to run shared pre and post processing code for its actions. These filters can be used to do 
    # authentication, caching, or auditing before the intended action is performed. Or to do localization or output 
    # compression after the action has been performed.
    #
    # Filters have access to the request, response, and all the instance variables set by other filters in the chain
    # or by the action (in the case of after filters). Additionally, it's possible for a pre-processing <tt>before_filter</tt>
    # to halt the processing before the intended action is processed by returning false or performing a redirect or render. 
    # This is especially useful for filters like authentication where you're not interested in allowing the action to be 
    # performed if the proper credentials are not in order.
    #
    # == Filter inheritance
    #
    # Controller inheritance hierarchies share filters downwards, but subclasses can also add new filters without
    # affecting the superclass. For example:
    #
    #   class BankController < ActionController::Base
    #     before_filter :audit
    #
    #     private
    #       def audit
    #         # record the action and parameters in an audit log
    #       end
    #   end
    #
    #   class VaultController < BankController
    #     before_filter :verify_credentials
    #
    #     private
    #       def verify_credentials
    #         # make sure the user is allowed into the vault
    #       end
    #   end
    #
    # Now any actions performed on the BankController will have the audit method called before. On the VaultController,
    # first the audit method is called, then the verify_credentials method. If the audit method returns false, then 
    # verify_credentials and the intended action is never called.
    #
    # == Filter types
    #
    # A filter can take one of three forms: method reference (symbol), external class, or inline method (proc). The first
    # is the most common and works by referencing a protected or private method somewhere in the inheritance hierarchy of
    # the controller by use of a symbol. In the bank example above, both BankController and VaultController use this form.
    #
    # Using an external class makes for more easily reused generic filters, such as output compression. External filter classes
    # are implemented by having a static +filter+ method on any class and then passing this class to the filter method. Example:
    #
    #   class OutputCompressionFilter
    #     def self.filter(controller)
    #       controller.response.body = compress(controller.response.body)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   class NewspaperController < ActionController::Base
    #     after_filter OutputCompressionFilter
    #   end
    #
    # The filter method is passed the controller instance and is hence granted access to all aspects of the controller and can
    # manipulate them as it sees fit.
    #
    # The inline method (using a proc) can be used to quickly do something small that doesn't require a lot of explanation. 
    # Or just as a quick test. It works like this:
    #
    #   class WeblogController < ActionController::Base
    #     before_filter { |controller| return false if controller.params["stop_action"] }
    #   end
    #
    # As you can see, the block expects to be passed the controller after it has assigned the request to the internal variables.
    # This means that the block has access to both the request and response objects complete with convenience methods for params,
    # session, template, and assigns. Note: The inline method doesn't strictly has to be a block. Any object that responds to call
    # and returns 1 or -1 on arity will do (such as a Proc or an Method object).
    #
    # == Filter chain ordering
    #
    # Using <tt>before_filter</tt> and <tt>after_filter</tt> appends the specified filters to the existing chain. That's usually
    # just fine, but some times you care more about the order in which the filters are executed. When that's the case, you
    # can use <tt>prepend_before_filter</tt> and <tt>prepend_after_filter</tt>. Filters added by these methods will be put at the
    # beginning of their respective chain and executed before the rest. For example:
    #
    #   class ShoppingController
    #     before_filter :verify_open_shop
    #
    #   class CheckoutController
    #     prepend_before_filter :ensure_items_in_cart, :ensure_items_in_stock
    #
    # The filter chain for the CheckoutController is now <tt>:ensure_items_in_cart, :ensure_items_in_stock,</tt>
    # <tt>:verify_open_shop</tt>. So if either of the ensure filters return false, we'll never get around to see if the shop 
    # is open or not.
    #
    # You may pass multiple filter arguments of each type as well as a filter block.
    # If a block is given, it is treated as the last argument.
    #
    # == Around filters
    #
    # In addition to the individual before and after filters, it's also possible to specify that a single object should handle
    # both the before and after call. That's especially usefuly when you need to keep state active between the before and after,
    # such as the example of a benchmark filter below:
    # 
    #   class WeblogController < ActionController::Base
    #     around_filter BenchmarkingFilter.new
    #     
    #     # Before this action is performed, BenchmarkingFilter#before(controller) is executed
    #     def index
    #     end
    #     # After this action has been performed, BenchmarkingFilter#after(controller) is executed
    #   end
    #
    #   class BenchmarkingFilter
    #     def initialize
    #       @runtime
    #     end
    #     
    #     def before
    #       start_timer
    #     end
    #     
    #     def after
    #       stop_timer
    #       report_result
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # == Filter conditions
    #
    # Filters can be limited to run for only specific actions. This can be expressed either by listing the actions to
    # exclude or the actions to include when executing the filter. Available conditions are +:only+ or +:except+, both 
    # of which accept an arbitrary number of method references. For example:
    #
    #   class Journal < ActionController::Base
    #     # only require authentication if the current action is edit or delete
    #     before_filter :authorize, :only => [ :edit, :delete ]
    #    
    #     private
    #       def authorize
    #         # redirect to login unless authenticated
    #       end
    #   end
    # 
    # When setting conditions on inline method (proc) filters the condition must come first and be placed in parenthesis.
    #
    #   class UserPreferences < ActionController::Base
    #     before_filter(:except => :new) { # some proc ... }
    #     # ...
    #   end
    #
