            "Social studies is an integrated study of the social sciences and humanities designed to foster citizenship in an interdependent world. Social studies provides coordinated, systematic study of such disciplines as economics, history, geography, government, sociology, anthropology, psychology and elements of the humanities. Social studies addresses political, economic, geographic, and social processes that allow students to make informed decisions for personal and public good. Social studies develops the knowledge, skills, and processes necessary to understand historical and present day connections among diverse individuals and groups. A study of Montana's rich past and geographic diversity includes the distinct cultural heritage and contemporary perspectives of Montana's American Indians and other cultural groups."

            "The primary purpose of social studies is to develop the ability to make informed and reasoned decisions for the public good as citizens of a culturally diverse, democratic society in an interdependent world (National Council of the Social Studies, 1994, p.3). The great architects of American public education, such as Thomas Jefferson, Horace Mann, and John Dewey, believed that every student must be well versed in our nation's history, the principles and practices which undergird citizenship, and the institutions that define our government. Understandings of commerce and geography were critical to their thinking as well. In essence, Jefferson, Mann, and Dewey viewed the study of social studies as critical to the mission of public schools. Indeed, they would applaud the inclusion of a \"responsible and involved citizen\" in the Guiding Principles, as well as social studies as one of eight content areas in the Learning Results."

They cover basic learning expectations including knowledge, skills, communication, thinking, understanding, and innovation. The first three commonalties (knowledge, skills, and communication) are most easily assessed with standardized tests. They are also easier to teach through direct instruction, rote learning, training, and guided practice. Because they are easier to teach and assess, they often make up the bulk of instruction in schools. The remaining three commonalties (thinking, understanding, and innovation) are not as easily assessed through standard measures and are not as easy to teach through direct instruction.

These content expectations represent a vision for a relevant physical education curriculum that addresses critical physical education knowledge, skills, fitness, and attitudes for successfully maintaining a physically-active lifestyle during a child's school years and beyond. They specify what a student should know and be able to do at the end of each grade."

            "The Georgia Performance Standards in Dance are organized by domains, standards, and corresponding elements. In congruence with the other Georgia Performance Standards, the dance standards and elements will provide the basis from which sample tasks, student work, and teacher commentary can be developed. The standards are separated by their individual grade levels from kindergarten to grade five. The middle school grades (6-8) are banded, yet delineated by proficient and advanced levels. High school standards are delineated as Dance 1, Dance 2, Dance 3, and Dance 4. This design provides flexibility for dance teachers so that they may differentiate instruction within any given class or grade based on a student's prior experiences with dance. It also enables flexibility for the variety of class schedules found in high schools and the mixed grades that occur within the study of dance."

Students demonstrate competence and confidence in a variety of genres and styles. They perform across cultural and professional boundaries. They communicate and inspire. They take responsibility and show initiative at the expected moment. Investigating the meanings and significance of the works of artists, choreographers, and technicians across time and space provides for the examination of ideas across disciplines. Students connect the concepts of dance to history, science, politics, religion, literature, drama, music, visual arts, and physical fitness. Dance can provide connections with any subject matter and help students to understand concepts important in other disciplines. Analyzing and critiquing dances \u2014 past and present \u2014 supports understanding of the relevance of the work in its time and culture."

            "The visual arts standards help educators to teach their students how to think like a \"genius.\" They provide inherent conceptual frameworks that are integral to higher-order thinking, expression, and experience. These discernments are intrinsic to the promotion, nurture and development of divergence in thought making and processing because they kindle the brain functions that spark innovation. When artists engage in the cognitive and experiential maneuvers provided by the visual arts, they are able to transform, reorganize, and transfer understanding into personal renderings and interpretations of the world around them. Verbal, logical, and number-sense brain functions are enhanced and accentuated by arts experiences, making the arts the \"genius\" centers for learning in the human brain. Contemporary brain research supports the notion of \"genius\" generated by arts experiences because of their direct impact on activating these brain functions."

Rather it offers a lens through which we can better focus on the teaching and learning of health that will carry our children into the next century. The seven Rhode Island standards for health education state what all Rhode Island students should know and be able to do as a result of K - 12 health education. The performance descriptions elaborating the standards suggest how students at various grade levels can demonstrate movement along the continuum to the eventual achievement of each standard.

Students practice using a set of tools for analyzing choices of all types, including those related to personal finance. Students learn the benefits of compound interest over time and that poor money management can lead to difficulty in obtaining credit. Students practice weighing costs and benefits of options when making choices about such things as careers, insurance, housing, investments, savings, automobiles and health care. Students practice these skills as they extend their understanding of the essential knowledge defined by the Standards of Learning for Economics and Personal Finance."

A comprehensive physical education program is designed to develop basic movement skills, sports skills, and physical fitness as well as to enhance mental, social and emotional activities. Further research has shown that physical activity among adolescents is consistently related to higher levels of self-esteem and lower levels of anxiety and stress. Physical activity is also positively associated with academic performance. Students who participate in school physical education programs do not experience any harmful effects on their standardized test scores, though less time is available for other academic subjects."

When actively engaged in these processes, students not only learn about the arts, they learn through and within the arts. The NCCAS National Arts Standards have four clusters (Create, Present, Respond & Connect) as their focal points. This difference will be reconciled in future iterations of New Jersey's Core Curriculum Content standards in Visual and Performing Arts."

Globalization is the ongoing process of increasing interconnectedness and interdependence among humankind. While its origins are debatable, this process has been significantly amplified with the onset of new communication technologies that have improved economic, political, social, cultural, historic, and geographic connections among individuals, groups, and nations. The mounting flow of goods, services, finances, ideas, and people across national and international borders has created a world ever more devoid of physical and political boundaries and dependent upon empathy and collaboration.

With the addition of PreK-3 Environment and Ecology Standards, it is suggested that Grade 1 focus on terrestrial habitats; Grade 2 focus on aquatic habitats; and Grade 3 focus on wetland habitats."

Dance is a performing art ideally taught sequentially with each level reinforcing and building upon skills taught at previous levels. Dance education is a study of \"the art of dance\" as well as the techniques involved in the various styles. As students learn and share dances from their own communities and other cultures, they gain skills and knowledge that will prepare them to become responsive participants in an increasingly global society, with a better understanding of dance from a recreational or vocational viewpoint. Each level of dance provides opportunities to correlate dance activities with other subjects thereby enriching learning."

Theatre electives must be offered to accommodate at least one level of student achievement (Theatre I). Electives must be provided to accommodate four sequential levels of student achievement (Theatre I - IV). The number of class periods for which theatre is offered will depend upon enrollment and the availability of space for acting, constructing costumes, scenery, and properties. Theatre classes provide opportunities for both individual and group projects. For this reason, students working at two, three, or four different achievement levels may be accommodated in a single class if the enrollment is small.

As students study the continents and regions across the globe, they will learn about the historic, cultural, economic, and political development as well as interconnections that occur in both human and physical systems of each area. During this study, students will develop the perspective of a global citizen, understanding that global-scale issues and problems are resolved through extensive collaboration among the world's peoples, nations, and economic organizations. Geographic inquiry helps students understand and appreciate their own place in the world and fosters curiosity about Earth's wide diversity of environments and cultures. Geography requires using spatial and environmental perspectives, asking and answering questions about global interconnections and spatial patterns, and applying geographic skills and tools. Creating maps and other geographic representations promotes the inquiry process and can be useful in making decisions and solving problems.

The arts are often asked to express that which cannot be expressed through words. The Priority Academic Student Skills (PASS) suggest benchmarks in the understanding of the arts for all students. Why is it important for each student to understand the significance of the arts in a historical, cultural, or aesthetic sense? Should students be encouraged to create meaningful, interpretive, original, or creative expressions? Will meaningful arts instruction give students the confidence they need to explore and create at the very highest of educational standards? Anthropologists have found evidence of the use of art for purposes of discussion as early as 70,000 years ago. The arts that are created today will one day be our contribution to this ongoing discussion of the human experience."

In a safe, nurturing environment, the arts enable students to express their feelings, communicate thoughts, explore their creativity, solve problems, communicate ideas, develop a sense of community, and appreciate themselves as participants in history, tradition, and culture. Learning in art, dance, drama, film, and music advances and strengthens motor skills, promotes considerate behavior, ability to work well with others, self discipline, perception, and sensitivity. Fine Arts experiences contribute to the developmental process of understanding one another and naturally motivate students in all their learning."

Students will learn that the Earth is an interacting system of both energy and matter. To understand the interaction, students must build on prior knowledge of matter and the factors the affect its behavior.

Studio Art 3-D is a course in which students further explore,apply, and move toward mastery of the elements of art and principles of design in specific areas of art, such as ceramics, jewelry, mosaics, fiber arts, sculptures, mixed media, altered books, or other 3-D media. Student art will demonstrate evidence of complex problem-solving skills, higher order thinking, risk taking, imagination, and innovation. Students will exhibit art and will assemble portfolios that reflect personal growth in the media, techniques, process, and tools used to create complex 3-D compositions. Student compositions will cover a breadth of media and subject matter and will demonstrate successful completion of Studio Art 3-D student learning expectations. Art I is a prerequisite for this course. The Standards for Accreditation require a one-half unit course of survey of fine arts or one-half unit of an advanced art or advanced music course. Studio Art 3-D may be used to fulfill this requirement. Arkansas Department of Education approval is not required for Studio Art 3-D."

Responsible and effective participation of citizens is stressed. Students understand the nature of citizenship, politics, and governments and understand the rights and responsibilities of citizens and how these are part of local, state, and national government. Students examine how the United States Constitution protects rights and provides the structure and functions of various levels of government. How the United States interacts with other nations and the government's role in world affairs will be examined. A focus on American interactions with other nations, and the government's role in world affairs, will also be included. Using primary and secondary resources, students articulate, evaluate, and defend positions on political issues. As a result, they will be able to explain the role of individuals and groups in government, politics, and civic activities and the need for civic and political engagement of citizens in the United States."

            "Study in the arts is an essential means---not an end---to acquiring thinking skills, creativity, the ability to change, and the facility to teach oneself. In a safe, nurturing environment, the arts enable students to express their feelings, communicate thoughts, explore their creativity, solve problems, communicate ideas, develop a sense of community, and appreciate themselves as participants in history, tradition, and culture. Learning in art, dance, drama, film, and music advances and strengthens motor skills, promotes considerate behavior, ability to work well with others, self discipline, perception, and sensitivity. Fine Arts experiences contribute to the developmental process of understanding one another and naturally motivate students in all their learning."

The four strands emphasize creating, performing/presenting, responding and connecting. In Creating, students generate ideas and original tangible works. In Performing and Presenting, students perform tasks associated with technical theatre and present their work to others. Through Responding, students examine works already created by themselves, their peers, or others to analyze the artistic merit and refine work. Through Connecting, students discover connections between theatrical works and historical, societal, and cultural context. Stagecraft I contains foundational elements of theatre that are not developed in Stagecraft II and III, but the teacher may choose to draw student learning expectations from the Drama II-III Curriculum Framework. Stagecraft II is a two-semester course which allows students to advance their skills in all elements of technical theatre through practical experience, with new instruction in design. Stagecraft III is a two-semester course which allows students to deepen their understanding and advance their skills in specialized elements of technical theatre, which could include scenery, props, lighting, sound, costume, and/or makeup. Stagecraft I fulfills the one-half unit of fine arts credit required for graduation. Arkansas Department of Education approval is not required for Stagecraft I, Stagecraft II, or Stagecraft III."

The standards were updated for all grades, K \u2013 12, and were aligned to the 2007 National Health Education Standards. Early drafts of the updated standards were reviewed by teachers, community health educators and university health education faculty. The standards were also posted online for review by Indiana teachers, administrators, school nurses, parents, physicians and community members. In the final step, the updated standards were again reviewed by national content reviewers for content, rigor, specificity, and comprehensiveness."

Students who select modern languages should be able to speak, read, write, and understand the foreign language they study; students who select a classical language should be able to read and understand the foreign language they study.

They are not intended to represent the full curriculum for instruction and assessment locally, nor are they meant to simply replace existing social studies curriculum. The set of GSEs includes concepts and skills intended to be for local assessment purposes only. Generally speaking, Grade Span Expectations \u2013 at any grade \u2013 represent content knowledge and skills that have been introduced instructionally at least one to two years before students are expected to demonstrate confidence in applying them independently."

            "This new set of standards provides CTE programs an opportunity to develop a single course for exploring a career pathway; as well as developing programs and pathways which include a sequence of courses that have an expectation of proficiency and mastery of skills for students who concentrate in CTE. These standards also serve as a framework to align existing course content to identify gaps and inform curricular decisions. However, it is not necessary for the whole set of health science to be used a measure of a course or program's completeness. Rather, distinctive conversations and informed decisions with involvement of multiple stakeholders, including business/industry and postsecondary representation, should be made regarding what is and what is not covered in a course, a sequence of courses, or a program. Where one district may focus, due to local and community needs or other influences, on a single pathway, another may fully develop multiple pathways. These standards provide a foundation for a variety of applications in each of Wisconsin's districts."

A coherent and complete view of what students should be able to do comes when the performance expectations are viewed in tandem with the contents of the foundation boxes that lie just below the performance expectations. These three boxes include the practices, core disciplinary ideas, and crosscutting concepts, derived from the National Research Council's Framework for K12 Science Education that were used to construct this set of performance expectations."

In many of those states, the standards are playing an important role in informing key policies affecting the training, licensing, induction, professional development and evaluation of school leaders.

            "By implementing a structured and standards-based music education, students continue the generational conversation and become fluent in the language of music as a manner of artistic, intellectual, and cultural expression. The acts of performing, creating and responding to music provide a means for development and growth in the ability to express the otherwise inexpressible and to facilitate growth in many areas of academic development. Learning to read and notate music opens for students the limitless body of musical styles, forms, and repertoire, and allows them to see what they hear and hear what they see. The interconnections in music bring together the understanding of contemporary and historical cultures as well as self-knowledge. Participation in music provides students with unique experiences and skills essential for success in the 21st century workforce."

Incorporating occupational health and safety principles into all aspects of work and the workplace is a fundamental step in the working process."

By observing and exploring the world using all their senses and by interacting with their classmates, they begin to connect their prior knowledge and experience with their experiences in new contexts to develop an understanding of the world around them. To meet the needs of these inquisitive children, the learning environment must be active, hands-on, child-centred, and inquiry-based. The teacher supports children through the problem-solving process, encouraging them to try something new, persist, and find alternative solutions. Teachers plan time for children to formally and informally share their questions and celebrate their discoveries."

Students apply the skills learned there in every content area; for example, students write science reports and make presentations in social studies classes. It is the same with research. While students often gain their research skills through instruction in the English language arts, the practice of those skills spans many content areas. Technology tools used within the English language arts classroom to enhance productivity, communication, and research can assist students as they construct models, prepare publications, and produce other creative works. Many of the standards set out for younger students are on the surface similar to those written for high school students. What changes between the sets of expectations is the developmental abilities of students to, for example, write more sophisticated compositions or to read more complex texts."

            "Science is a way of knowing, a process for gaining knowledge and understanding of the natural world. Engineering combines the fields of science, technology, and mathematics to provide solutions to real-world problems. Students should be active learners who demonstrate their scientific understanding by using it. It is not enough for students to read about science; they must participate in the three dimensions of science. They should observe, inquire, question, formulate and test hypotheses, analyze data, report, and evaluate findings. The students, as scientists, should have hands-on, active experiences throughout the instruction of the science curriculum. These standards help students find value in developing novel solutions as they engage with complex problems."

Within the context of mathematical modeling and data analysis, students will study functions and their behaviors, systems of inequalities, probability, experimental design and implementation, and analysis of data. These standards include a transformational approach to graphing functions and writing equations when given the graph of the equation. Transformational graphing builds a strong connection between algebraic and graphic representations of functions."

These standards include a transformational approach to graphing functions. Transformational graphing uses translation, reflection, dilation, and rotation to generate a \"family of functions\" from a given \"parent\" function and builds a strong connection between algebraic and graphic representations of functions. Students will vary the coefficients and constants of an equation, observe the changes in the graph of the equation, and make generalizations that can be applied to many graphs."

An elementary science program engages students in a process of inquiry and problem solving in which they develop both knowledge and skills.

Elementary and secondary science programs help prepare students for life in a rapidly changing world-a world of expanding knowledge and technology in which new challenges and opportunities continually arise. Tomorrow's citizens will live in a changing environment in which increasingly complex questions and issues will need to be addressed.

In each of the eight overarching English language arts standards, concepts and skills are expressed in terms of both reading and writing, intended to support integrated, rather than isolated, reading/writing instruction. Research supports this integrated model of English language arts, where students read to understand the meaning and composition of a text and write with readers' expectations and assumptions in mind."

            "These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness."

The study of United States History will enable students to understand the development and expansion of a market economy and the economic forces that drove the growth of a continental power. In addition, students will examine the foundational documents and democratic practices that define the growth of the American Republic. Students will analyze the processes and mechanisms that increased the body politic and the impact of different cultures on the development of an American identity. By considering events from multiple perspectives students will understand that women, African Americans, American Indians and other minorities possess historical agency."

            "These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are accessible using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness."

The standards help educators create a student-centered approach to social studies in which critical skills and inquiry are the focus, rather than rote memorization of facts. These standards reflect an instructional shift and will enhance education for every student in an increasingly complex and fast-paced society. Social studies educators are responsible both for giving students the tools they need to be successful once they leave the classroom, as well as shaping the civic and social consciousness of the future leaders of our country."
