            "These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness."

Students will analyze the processes and mechanisms that increased the body politic and the impact of different cultures on the development of an American identity. By considering events from multiple perspectives students will understand that women, African Americans, Native Americans and other minorities possess historical agency. Awareness of these processes assist student comprehension of the complicated nature of the American story."

Students will explore such foundational topics as: what it means to be human, created in God's image, what is culture, Christ and culture, living together in solidarity, social justice, prayer and sacrament, friendship and intimacy. Connections between the living Church and contemporary culture are explored in terms of what it means to be a responsible Christian adolescent in a secularized, pluralistic world."

            "United States History Studies Since 1877 is based on the founding documents of the U.S. government, which provide a framework for its heritage. Historical content focuses on the political, economic, and social events and issues related to industrialization and urbanization, major wars, domestic and foreign policies, and reform movements, including civil rights. Students examine the impact of geographic factors on major events and eras and analyze their causes and effects. Students examine the impact of constitutional issues on American society, evaluate the dynamic relationship of the three branches of the federal government, and analyze efforts to expand the democratic process. Students describe the relationship between the arts and popular culture and the times during which they were created. Students analyze the impact of technological innovations on American life. Students use critical-thinking skills and a variety of primary and secondary source material to explain and apply different methods that historians use to understand and interpret the past, including multiple points of view and historical context."

Students learn major political ideas and forms of government in history. A significant focus of the course is on the U.S. Constitution, its underlying principles and ideas, and the form of government it created. Students analyze major concepts of republicanism, federalism, checks and balances, separation of powers, popular sovereignty, and individual rights and compare the U.S. system of government with other political systems. Students identify the role of government in the U.S. free enterprise system and examine the strategic importance of places to the United States. Students analyze the impact of individuals, political parties, interest groups, and the media on the American political system, evaluate the importance of voluntary individual participation in a constitutional republic, and analyze the rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Students examine the relationship between governmental policies and the culture of the United States. Students identify examples of government policies that encourage scientific research and use critical-thinking skills to create a product on a contemporary government issue."

Standards evolve from specifics to deeper structures inherent in the discipline. These deeper structures serve to connect the specifics. The standards follow such a design, stressing conceptual understanding of key ideas and continually returning to organizing principles such as place value or the properties of operations to structure those ideas. The sequence of topics and performances outlined in mathematics standards must respect the scientific research about how students learn and what is known about how their mathematical knowledge, skill, and understanding develop over time."

Research supports this integrated model of English language arts, where students read to understand the meaning and composition of a text and write with readers' expectations and assumptions in mind."

Today's mathematics students need a repertoire of knowledge and skills that are more diverse, complex, and integrated than any previous generation. Three themes are used to describe these important skills and competencies and are interwoven throughout the standards: inquiry questions; relevance and application; and the nature of each discipline. These competencies should not be thought of stand-alone concepts, but should be integrated throughout the curriculum in all grade levels. Just as it is impossible to teach thinking skills to students without the content to think about, it is equally impossible for students to understand the content of a discipline without grappling with complex questions and the investigation of topics."

Le programme-cadre de langues autochtones a pour but ultime de susciter chez les élèves autochtones une fierté dans leur langue ancestrale et de les amener à l'utiliser pour communiquer tous les jours – en d'autres termes, à l'utiliser comme une langue vivante, partie intégrante d'une culture vivante."

Through learning a second language, students strengthen their first-language skills, enhance their critical and creative thinking abilities, and increase their understanding of other cultures. In addition, the ability to communicate in another language provides students with a distinct advantage in a number of careers, both in Canada and internationally."

The ultimate goal of the Native language program is to inspire Native students with pride in their ancestral language and to motivate them to use it to communicate in their daily lives – to use it, in other words, as a living language that is part of a living culture."

Arts courses for the first two years of secondary school are designed to appeal to students' interests and imagination, and provide a basis for more intensive and specialized study. In all arts subjects in Grades 11 and 12, emphasis is placed on acquiring more advanced skills and applying them in more complex ways. An important aim of the Grade 11 and 12 courses is to help students understand the world in which they live and to help them make choices that will both enrich their lives and prepare them for a variety of careers. To this end, course content is designed to encourage students to understand the connections between what they are doing at the Grade 11 and 12 levels and what is required in a broad range of university and college programs and the world of work."

Le programme d'études donne aux élèves l'occasion de développer les compétences, les processus, les attitudes et les habitudes mentales scientifiques qui leur permettront de poursuivre leurs investigations de manière autonome, en appliquant des méthodes scientifiques. En mettant à contribution leur pensée critique, leur pensée créatrice et les connaissances scientifiques qu'ils possèdent déjà, les élèves collaborent, explorent, résolvent des problèmes, communiquent, innovent, découvrent et améliorent leur compréhension des sciences dans le cadre d'expériences pratiques. Le programme offre aux élèves des occasions de développer une conscience personnelle et sociale de leurs rôles et responsabilités par rapport à l'environnement. En cultivant une appréciation pour le domaine des sciences, l'élève apprend à reconnaître les occasions d'appliquer ses connaissances dans sa vie quotidienne ou de contribuer à la science dans une future carrière."

Il est aussi étroitement lié aux valeurs exprimées dans les principes d'apprentissage des peuples autochtones. Les élèves sont amenés à développer des habiletés artistiques dans quatre disciplines essentielles, soit la danse, l'art dramatique, la musique et les arts visuels. Chacune de ces disciplines est unique en son genre et d'importance égale, et les quatre se combinent naturellement pour favoriser le développement intellectuel, social, émotif et physique des élèves. Tous les élèves ont la capacité et le potentiel de créer et de s'engager dans les arts, et de développer leurs forces et capacités individuelles."

            "Art education is concerned with the organization of visual material. A primary reliance upon visual experience gives an emphasis that sets it apart from the performing arts. Acquiring proficiency in art requires systematic instruction in how we see, interpret and make sense of visual stimuli. It requires an understanding of how others interpret the visual messages which are products of this kind of activity. It requires an education in the use of traditional and contemporary tools, materials and media. Art education is concerned with having individuals think and behave as artists. For the purposes of art education, the term \"artist\" is equally valid to describe one who has worked for a lifetime or someone who is a relative beginner. Ultimately, art is accessible to all individuals. Its practice results in changing the individual, in changing the relationship among individuals, or in changing the social/physical environment. Art education is concerned with pointing out the values that surround the creation and cherishing of art forms. Art is not merely created, it is valued. The relative values given to art products not only tell us about those who produce them, but introduce notions of how values have changed over time. Learning to see gives us the means to view the works of others and perhaps to relate that to our own works. In this case, however, searching for organization may be helped by knowledge about other people's priorities. Art education deals with ways in which people express their feelings in visual forms. Art takes the human condition as the focus of study. Persons involved in the visual arts reflect upon and externalize their personal feelings and intuitions or those of their fellow human beings. As artists, they share this ability with the writer, the poet and the musician. In making parallels and discovering relationships with the performing and literary arts we gain a sense of common purpose. Art education deals with making and defending qualitative judgments about artworks. Becoming a perceptive"

In Algebra I, students analyze and explain precisely the process of solving an equation. Students, through reasoning, develop fluency writing, interpreting, and translating between various forms of linear equations and inequalities and make conjectures about the form that a linear equation might take in a solution to a problem. They reason abstractly and quantitatively by choosing and interpreting units in the context of creating equations in two variables to represent relationships between quantities. They master the solution of linear equations and apply related solution techniques and the properties of exponents to the creation and solution of simple exponential equations."

These K-12 social studies standards highlight the framework for professional deliberation and planning for social studies education in Nevada. The standards help educators create a student-centered approach to social studies in which critical skills and inquiry are the focus, rather than rote memorization of facts. These standards reflect an instructional shift and will enhance education for every student in an increasingly complex and fast-paced society. Social studies educators are responsible both for giving students the tools they need to be successful once they leave the classroom, as well as shaping the civic and social consciousness of the future leaders of our country."

It enables them to develop an understanding of the past and present experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, their identities and the continuing value of their cultures. It also helps students to appreciate Australia's distinctive path of social, economic and political development, its position in the Asia and Pacific regions, and its global interrelationships.

Just as students must learn to read, write, speak, listen, and use language effectively in a variety of content areas, so too must the Standards specify the literacy skills and understandings required for college and career readiness in multiple disciplines. Literacy standards for grade 6 and above are predicated on teachers of ELA, history/social studies, science, and technical subjects using their content area expertise to help students meet the particular challenges of reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language in their respective fields. It is important to note that the 6–12 literacy standards in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects are not meant to replace content standards in those areas but rather to supplement them. States may incorporate these standards into their standards for those subjects or adopt them as content area literacy standards."

A second aim is to enable each student to understand and appreciate language and to use it confidently and competently for a variety of purposes, with a variety of audiences and in a variety of situations for communication, personal satisfaction and learning. An appreciation of literature and an ability to use language effectively enhance students' opportunities to become responsible, contributing citizens and lifelong learners while experiencing success and fulfillment in life. As strong language users, students will be able to meet Alberta's graduation requirements and will be prepared for entry into post-secondary studies or the workplace.

To ensure relevance to students as well as to societal needs, a science program must present science in a meaningful context—providing opportunities for students to explore the process of science, its applications and implications, and to examine related technological problems and issues.

            "Children have a natural curiosity about their surroundings-a desire to explore and investigate, see inside things, find out how things work and find answers to their questions. Learning about science provides a framework for students to understand and interpret the world around them. An elementary science program engages students in a process of inquiry and problem solving in which they develop both knowledge and skills. The purpose of the program is to encourage and stimulate children's learning by nurturing their sense of wonderment, by developing skill and confidence in investigating their surroundings and by building a foundation of experience and understanding upon which later learning can be based. Elementary and secondary science programs help prepare students for life in a rapidly changing world-a world of expanding knowledge and technology in which new challenges and opportunities continually arise. Tomorrow's citizens will live in a changing environment in which increasingly complex questions and issues will need to be addressed. The decisions and actions of future citizens need to be based on an awareness and understanding of their world and on the ability to ask relevant questions, seek answers, define problems and find solutions"

Because it is built on the middle grades standards, this is a more ambitious version of Algebra I than has generally been offered. The critical areas, called units, deepen and extend understanding of linear and exponential relationships by contrasting them with each other and by applying linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend, and students engage in methods for analyzing, solving, and using quadratic functions."

Students are held responsible for learning standards listed at earlier grade levels as well as their current grade level. Throughout this document, the standards are written to allow time for study of additional material at every grade level. The order of the standards at any grade level is not meant to imply a sequence of topics and should be considered flexible for the organization of any course. The document provides standards for PK-7, Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II with Algebra I as the pre-requisite for both Geometry and Algebra II."

In choosing themes, consideration is given to the student's developmental stage and immediate needs and interests, including the 7-12 content areas.

As we are sexual beings, youth will need to understand and come to terms with their own sexuality and matters of sexual health while being aware of the continuum of sexual orientation and what that means for the role we play in our relations with others at home, in school and in the community. Adolescence may be characterized for some as a time when they may have more questions than answers.

            "The Grade 3 Health program focuses the healthy development of an individual and on the environment locally and globally, and the impact environment has on health. It is the goal of this curriculum to provide students with the knowledge and skills to make decisions that promote optimum health. Through a variety of teaching and learning strategies, students will examine aspects of their own growth and development in relation to overall health. Equally important to bodily health is mental health. Family and friends play a significant role in the healthy development of our being. Students will reflect on the impact they have on others and develop strategies to deal with others in a positive way. Finally, the health of the environment is examined as a mechanism that sustains life. From the microcosm of our own homes to the community at large, individuals have a role to play in protecting the environment in which we live."

Stages 1 and 2 provide the content and performance indicators for introduction of a target language. Stages 3 and 4 are included to provide students with the opportunity to further their language knowledge and proficiency. The four stages do not represent grade levels or years of study; they describe the content knowledge and skills needed to be proficient at each stage. The Stages can begin at any grade level; however, the introduction of World Languages is encouraged at the elementary level. Students are expected to attain the Intermediate-Low level of proficiency through Stage 2."

            "The fourth-grade standards place emphasis on multiplication and division with whole numbers and solving problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions and decimals. Students will develop fluency with multiplication through 12 x 12 and the corresponding division facts as they become proficient in multiplying larger numbers. Students will apply knowledge of place value and the properties of addition and multiplication as strategies for solving problems. Students also will refine their estimation skills for computations and measurements. Students will identify and describe representations of points, lines, line segments, rays, and angles, including endpoints and vertices. Students will describe and compare characteristics of plane and solid figures. Concrete models and pictorial representations will be used to solve problems involving perimeter and area, patterns, probability, and equivalence of fractions and decimals."

Students will apply knowledge of place value and the properties of addition and multiplication as strategies for solving problems. Concrete models and pictorial representations will be used to introduce addition and subtraction with fractions and the concept of probability as the measurement of chance. Students will use standard units (U.S. Customary and metric) to measure temperature, length, and liquid volume. Properties of shapes, points, line segments, rays, angles, vertices, and lines will be explored and students will identify polygons with 10 or fewer sides, combine and subdivide polygons, and name the resulting polygon(s)."

            "Today, quality science education enables students to learn science by being actively involved with scientific and engineering practices as they progress from kindergarten through 12th grade. They are encouraged to be inquisitive, to actively explore their environment, and become productive, scientifically literate citizens. The standards presented here provide the necessary foundation for local school district decisions about curriculum, assessments, and instruction. Implementation of the new standards will better prepare Wyoming high school graduates for the rigors of college and/or careers. In turn, Wyoming employers will be able to hire workers with a strong science and engineering base — both in specific content areas and in critical thinking and inquiry-based problem solving."

The physical science standards include abstract concepts such as the conceptualization of the structure of atoms and the role they play in determining the properties of materials, motion and forces, the conservation of energy and matter, wave behavior, electricity, and the relationship between electricity and magnetism. The idea of radioactive decay is limited to the understanding of whole half-lives and how a constant proportional rate of decay is consistent with declining measures that only gradually approach to zero. Students investigate physical science concepts through the study of phenomena, experiences in laboratory settings, and field work."

These standards engage the students in constructing explanations of phenomena fundamental to the sciences of geology and physical geography, including the early history of the Earth, plate tectonics, landform evolution, the Earth's geologic record, weather and climate, and the history of life on Earth. Instruction should focus on development of scientific explanations, rather than mere descriptions of phenomena. Case studies, laboratory exercises, maps, and data analysis should be integrated into units. Special attention should be paid to topics of current interest (e.g., recent earthquakes, tsunamis, global warming, price of resources) and to potential careers in the geosciences."

At the appropriate times, students will ask, \"How do you know?\" and will attempt to answer the question. They will use whole numbers as well as basic fractions (such as one-half and one-fourth) to identify and analyze scientific data. Second graders will find sums and differences of single digit numbers and then justify the answer. They will give rough estimates to problems and estimate lengths, weights, and time intervals. They will explain to others how to solve numerical problems related to a science activity."

First graders use whole numbers to analyze scientific data. They identify how magnets pull on all things made of iron and either attract or repel other magnets. First graders create drawings that correctly depict something being described. The students are asked to plan and carry out simple investigations to understand patterns (shadows, sound, weather, and daily needs of plants and animals) observed in the world around them and make predictions based on these investigations. They follow safety rules."

The program is defined as an enrichment of the Core French program by the creation of a period of intensive exposure to French which enables students to receive in one school year up to four times the number of hours of instruction normally devoted to Core French. In Core French, and similarly in Intensive Core French, students participate in a language development program, emphasizing many of the skills found in English Language Arts. French as a second language study offers important opportunities to students in their quest to become literate, articulate, effective communicators in English and in French."

            "The fundamental purpose of the course in Geometry is to formalize and extend students' geometric experiences from the middle grades. Students explore more complex geometric situations and deepen their explanations of geometric relationships, moving towards formal mathematical arguments. Important differences exist between this Geometry course and the historical approach taken in Geometry classes. For example, transformations are emphasized early in this course. Close attention should be paid to the introductory content for the Geometry conceptual category found in the high school AMS."

The intent of the geography domain is for students to begin to grasp the importance geography plays in their everyday lives. The government/civics domain focuses on selected types of government found in the various areas so that students begin to understand the variety of governments in the world. The economics domain builds on the K-5 economics standards; however, the focus shifts from the United States to how other countries answer the basic questions of economics. The history domain focuses on major events in each region during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries."

Students should be active learners who demonstrate their scientific understanding by using it. It is not enough for students to read about science; they must participate in the three dimensions of science. They should observe, inquire, question, formulate and test hypotheses, analyze data, report, and evaluate findings. The students, as scientists, should have hands-on, active experiences throughout the instruction of the science curriculum.

The essential standards of this course are organized under three strands – Civics and Government, Personal Financial Literacy and Economics. The Civics and Government strand is framed to develop students' increased understanding of the institutions of constitutional democracy and the fundamental principles and values upon which they are founded, the skills necessary to participate as effective and responsible citizens and the knowledge of how to use democratic procedures for making decisions and managing conflict. The Economic and Personal Financial Literacy strands are framed to provide students with an understanding of the role economic factors play in making economic decisions, the ability to reason logically about key economic issues and the knowledge and skills needed to manage personal financial resources effectively for lifetime financial security. Taken together, these three strands should help to prepare students to become responsible and effective citizens in an interdependent world."

It is also beyond the scope of the Standards to define the full range of supports appropriate for English language learners and for students with special needs. At the same time, all students must have the opportunity to learn and meet the same high standards if they are to access the knowledge and skills necessary in their post-school lives."

These sets of skills and knowledge bases are essential for our students, so they may fully participate in our nation's economy and political processes. These standards do contain references to the Common Core Social Studies reading and writing literacy skills. In 2014, House Bill 3399 repealed Common Core standards for Oklahoma. By operation of law, the references to Common Core in the Social Studies subject standards are no longer in effect, but all other elements of the standards apply in their entirety."

This is paramount if students are to achieve significant improvement in programs that teach a second language through cognitively complex content taught through problem-solving and discovery learning in highly interactive classroom activities. All students will, indeed, learn a second language most effectively through content instruction and when afforded an extended, continuous, and uninterrupted time period in which to do so."

Staff from state departments of education reviewed and provided feedback on early drafts leading to a public comment period for citizens and educators. Adopting the Common Core State Standards bring academic consistency within and across the states."

The scope of English language arts study extends far beyond the English language arts classroom. Students apply the skills learned there in every content area; for example, students write science reports and make presentations in social studies classes. It is the same with research. While students often gain their research skills through instruction in the English language arts, the practice of those skills spans many content areas. Technology tools used within the English language arts classroom to enhance productivity, communication, and research can assist students as they construct models, prepare publications, and produce other creative works. Many of the standards set out for younger students are on the surface similar to those written for high school students. What changes between the sets of expectations is the developmental abilities of students to, for example, write more sophisticated compositions or to read more complex texts."

They are therefore quite generalized, not specifying particular technologies or techniques, and containing very few examples of terminology and activities.

Schools can better achieve their basic educational mission if students are healthy and fit physically, mentally, socially, and emotionally. Habits that young people establish will impact their future health status in a positive or negative manner. Schools share the responsibility with parents and communities to help prevent unnecessary injury, disease, and chronic health conditions that lead to a low quality of life, disability, or early death. In addition, positive attitudes and behaviors developed early in life help to prevent many of the social and educational problems that confront society, including failure to complete high school, drug addiction, broken homes, unemployment, and criminal behavior."

The emphasis is on providing success and enjoyment for all students, and not just for those who are \"physically gifted.\" The Physical Education Core represents a shift from a team sports-dominated program to a lifetime activity format with connections to community resources. Knowledge of the relationship between proper nutrition and the benefits of a consistent fitness regimen is the common thread running through the Physical Education Core. Reading and writing practices such as reports, activity journals, and portfolios are incorporated in the Core to broaden the physical education experience and to contribute to the overall literacy of students.

Students should be active learners. It is not enough for students to read about science; they must do science. They should observe, inquire, question, formulate and test hypotheses, analyze data, report, and evaluate findings. The students, as scientists, should have hands-on, active experiences throughout the instruction of the science curriculum."

The Physical Education Core Curriculum utilizes appropriate instructional practices to develop competence and confidence in a variety of lifetime activity and movement forms including sports, dance, recreational, and physical fitness activities. The emphasis is on providing success and enjoyment for all students; not just for those who are \"physically gifted.\" Knowledge of the relationship between proper nutrition and a consistent fitness regimen is the common thread running through the Physical Education Core. Students develop Life Skills through cooperative and competitive activity participation, and learn to value academic service experiences."

By observing and exploring the world using all their senses and by interacting with their classmates, they begin to connect their prior knowledge and experience with their experiences in new contexts to develop an understanding of the world around them. To meet the needs of these inquisitive children, the learning environment must be active, hands-on, child-centred, and inquiry-based. The teacher supports children through the problem-solving process, encouraging them to try something new, persist, and find alternative solutions. Teachers plan time for children to formally and informally share their questions and celebrate their discoveries."

These standards also serve as a framework to align existing course content to identify gaps and inform curricular decisions. However, the full scope of a set of standards should not be used as a measure of a course or program's completeness. Rather, distinctive conversations and informed decisions with involvement of multiple stakeholders, including business/industry and postsecondary representation, should be made regarding what is and what is not covered in a course, a sequence of courses or a program. Where one district may focus, due to local and community needs or other influences, on a single pathway, another may fully develop multiple pathways.

Subsequently, Standards of Learning were developed for all academic content areas. The Standards of Learning provide a framework for instructional programs designed to raise the academic achievement of all students in Virginia. School divisions and teachers have worked to incorporate the standards in local curriculum and classroom instruction. As part of the Board's seven-year cycle, the review process occurred again in 2008 and resulted in the standards contained in this document. Review committee members were encouraged to be judicious in the scope of their recommendations in consideration of the burden to school divisions of aligning curriculum, instructional materials, and professional development initiatives with the revised standards."

College- and career-readiness is supported in English language arts as students acquire and further develop their abilities to be critical consumers of what they read or hear and informed sources when they write or speak."

One must be able to participate appropriately in face-to-face interaction with members of other societies. It is also necessary to interpret the concepts, ideas, and opinions of members of these societies, as expressed through their media and their literature. It is obvious that students only attain this ability when language study is initiated as early as possible and continued over an extended period of time. Futhermore, knowledge of the linguistic system of a given language—its grammar, vocabulary, and phonology-are important in supporting successful communication."

            "The 2009 Minnesota Academic Standards in Science set the expectations for achievement in science for K-12 students in Minnesota. The standards are grounded in the belief that all students can and should be scientifically literate. Scientific literacy enables people to use scientific principles and processes to make personal decisions and to participate in discussions of scientific issues that affect society (NRC, 1996). The standards and benchmarks describe a connected body of science and engineering knowledge acquired through active participation in science experiences. These experiences include hands-on laboratory activities rooted in scientific inquiry and engineering design. The standards are placed at the grade level where mastery is expected with recognition that a progression of learning experiences in earlier grades builds the foundation for mastery later on."

The acts of performing, creating and responding to music provide a means for development and growth in the ability to express the otherwise inexpressible and to facilitate growth in many areas of academic development. Learning to read and notate music opens for students the limitless body of musical styles, forms, and repertoire, and allows them to see what they hear and hear what they see. The interconnections in music bring together the understanding of contemporary and historical cultures as well as self-knowledge. Participation in music provides students with unique experiences and skills essential for success in the 21st century workforce."

            "The development of the ISLLC (Interstate School Leader Licensure Consortium) in 1996 was a milestone in helping states and school districts define how leaders can positively influence learning and establishing guidelines to ensure that they do so. More than 40 states have since adopted the ISLLC standards or used them as the basis for their own standards. In many of those states, the standards are playing an important role in informing key policies affecting the training, licensing, induction, professional development and evaluation of school leaders. With Wallace support, these guidelines have been revised by the Council of Chief State School Officers, applying the growth in knowledge about effective leadership practices over the last decade. This publication spells out the changes and their significance for improving leadership policy and practice."

The United States' position in the global economy is declining, in part because U.S. workers lack fundamental knowledge in these fields. To address the critical issues of U.S. competitiveness and to better prepare the workforce, A Framework for K-12 Science Education proposes a new approach to K-12 science education that will capture students' interest and provide them with the necessary foundational knowledge in the field."

These standards assume that literacy growth begins before children enter school as they experience and experiment with literacy activities—reading and writing, and associating spoken words with their graphic representations. Recognizing this fact, these standards encourage the development of curriculum and instruction that make productive use of the emerging literacy abilities that children bring to school. Furthermore, the standards provide ample room for the innovation and creativity essential to teaching and learning. They are not prescriptions for particular curriculum or instruction."

The standards incorporate both traditional means of artistic expression and newer media, such as cinematography, video, and computer-generated art. The visual and performing arts standards reflect our belief that all children should have access to challenging curriculum content, exhibit a high level of performance proficiency, and be prepared for the world of tomorrow."

The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for English Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science and Technical Subjects and the CCSS for Mathematics define the knowledge and skills students need to succeed in college and careers when they graduate. In Hawaii, English language arts, teachers in grades k-2, 11-12 and mathematics teachers in grades k-2 and algebra II will begin implementing the CCSS in school year 2011-2012. All teachers will teach the CCSS in school year 2013-2014."

A coherent and complete view of what students should be able to do comes when the performance expectations are viewed in tandem with the contents of the foundation boxes that lie just below the performance expectations. These three boxes include the practices, core disciplinary ideas, and crosscutting concepts, derived from the National Research Council's Framework for K12 Science Education that were used to construct this set of performance expectations."

American History II includes content from late nineteenth century to early 21st century. Students will examine the political, economic, social and cultural development of the United States of America from the end of the Reconstruction era to the present. The desired outcome of both American History courses is for students to develop an understanding of the cause‐and‐effect relationship between past and present events, recognize patterns of interactions, and understand the impact of events in the United States of America in an interconnected world."

To reap the benefits of the science standards, states should adopt them in whole, without alteration. Adoption of the standards is only the first step toward improving educational opportunities for all students. For states that adopt the standards, they will need to be implemented in every classroom. As the standards will not define a curriculum, states and local districts will have the responsibility for providing more detailed guidance to classroom teachers, and will have room to fill in specific content to help students learn the key ideas in the standards."

Emphasis should be placed upon study of Native American Indian cultures, European exploration, colonization, settlement, revolution against British rule, the founding of the Republic and the beginnings of the United States. Students also learn to describe the major components of our national government and to demonstrate responsible citizenship in the classroom and school setting."

Learning experiences for seventh grade students should help them to make the transition from concrete information to abstract ideas, concepts, and generalizations. In-depth studies provide greater understanding of environmental influences on economic, cultural, and political institutions. Opportunities to develop thinking and research skills include reading and interpreting maps, graphs, and charts. Decision-making and problem-solving activities should include the following: (1) identifying problems, issues and questions; (2) information gathering; (3) hypothesizing; and (4) evaluating alternative solutions and actions."

Students study global patterns of physical and cultural characteristics, including the Earth/sun relationship, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, landforms, climate, vegetation, population, economic and political structures, culture, cultural diffusion, and international and interregional connections. Using maps, geographic representations and technology such as geographic information systems (GIS) students examine spatial relationships, the interaction of physical and cultural characteristics of designated places, areas, or regions. Students are expected to apply knowledge of geographic concepts and uses of geography to inquiry, research, and use participatory processes. Guiding course content are the themes of location, characteristic of place, human/environmental interaction, movement between places, and regions. Emphasized are elements of the National Geography Standards: The World in Spatial Terms, Places and Regions, Physical Systems, Human Systems and, Environment and Society."

Modeling real world situations is an important part of this course. Sequences and series will be used to represent and analyze real world problems and mathematical situations. Algebra III will also include a study of matrices and conics. Arkansas teachers are responsible for integrating appropriate technology and including the eight Standards for Mathematical Practice found in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M).

These standards also serve as a framework to align existing course content to identify gaps and inform curricular decisions. However, it is not necessary for the whole set of health science to be used a measure of a course or program's completeness. Rather, distinctive conversations and informed decisions with involvement of multiple stakeholders, including business/industry and postsecondary representation, should be made regarding what is and what is not covered in a course, a sequence of courses, or a program. Where one district may focus, due to local and community needs or other influences, on a single pathway, another may fully develop multiple pathways. These standards provide a foundation for a variety of applications in each of Wisconsin's districts."

Concepts learned in the classroom are reinforced in the gymnasium and vice versa. Health is essential to a quality of life and leads directly to improved learning. Health enhancement develops the skills and behaviors necessary for students to become healthy, productive citizens who take personal responsibility for their own well-being as well as a social responsibility for the health of their community. Early initiation of healthy behaviors is a predictor of enhanced school performance as well as less risk for morbidity and premature mortality in adulthood. Health enhancement is a critical component of the educational process."

The standards show the gradual progression through five ELD levels, starting with a student who has no knowledge of English and begins to acquire skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing at benchmark stages until reaching English fluency. ELD standards are the on-ramp to language arts standards and were developed with achievement of the language arts standards as the ultimate objective. Some ELD standards at the Early Fluent and Fluent levels contain wording similar to the Language Arts standards, reflecting this very goal."

As school district's build curriculum documents, it is understood that concepts and skills should be introduced at earlier grade levels, assessed at the GLE level, and continue to be reviewed/reinforced at later grade levels. At each grade level, students should be able to demonstrate the GLEs from previous years as well as those specified for the current grade.

National Standards for Visual Art provided a foundation for development of the Georgia standards. Advisors' suggestions led to the combination of two national standards and the placement of \"production\" at the heart—in the middle—of the standards arrangement. The domains are as follows: Meaning and Creative Thinking (MC), Contextual Understanding (CU), Production and Response (PR), Assessment and Reflection (AR), and Connections (C)."

All students are expected to master the K-11 standards, and the NeSA Math assessment is given at the end of 11th grade. Many colleges and universities require four years of high school mathematics for admission, and some of the content reflected in the Advanced Topics (Grade 12) standards may be recommended for particular majors in postsecondary education. Therefore, students entering postsecondary education are encouraged to take additional math courses that will help them become college and career ready through the Advanced Topic standards."

Outcomes are meant to inform content standards, assessment, provide information to teachers and students regarding student progress toward mastery of the standards, and specify targets for instruction and learning. The document presents a starting point for informed dialogue among those dedicated and committed to quality education in South Dakota. By providing a common set of goals and expectations for all students in all schools, this dialogue will be strengthened and enhanced."

The implementation of ELP standards is essential for educators and learners so that their teaching and learning aligns with the expectations of the Michigan English Language Arts Standards and further ensures English language learners access to the full content area curriculum. Since current research has shown that language proficiency is further developed through academic application, core curriculum subjects such as social studies, science, and mathematics serve as the wider context for English language development, progress toward language proficiency, and overall academic achievement."

The standards support the arts in the ―academic standing in that mere participation is not the same as education. The standards affirm that discipline and rigor are critical to high academic achievement. Academic achievement, knowledge, and skills can be measured in the arts– if not always on a numerical scale, then by informed critical judgment. Performance-based assessment has long been used in the arts that include the practice of portfolio review in the visual arts and the assessment of performance skills through auditions used in dance, music, and theatre."

Because music is a basic expression of human culture, every student must have access to a balanced comprehensive and sequential program of study in music during the school day, including the opportunity to perform and attend performances. Singing, playing instruments, moving to music, and creating music enables students to acquire musical skills and knowledge that can be developed in no other way. Learning to read and notate music gives them skills to explore music independently. Listening to, analyzing, and evaluating music are important building blocks of musical learning.

This breadth of background enables students to begin to understand the connections and relationships between music and other disciplines.

            "Social Studies standards provide a clear picture to students, teachers, school administrators, parents, and the community as to what is expected of students. In this way they help to demystify teaching, learning, and assessment by making public what, why, and how students need to learn and teachers need to teach. Standards serve as clear and consistent targets of performance and serve as reference points for aligning all parts of the educational system—its policies, programs, classroom practices, and curricular support. All of the decisions made at all levels in our school system are made with the idea of supporting schools' and teachers' efforts to have students accomplish the standards."

            "Policy 2520.55 is organized around the three major components of a standards-based curriculum: learning standards, instructional objectives and performance descriptors. The learning standards are the broad descriptions of what all students must know and be able to do at the conclusion of the instructional sequence. The accompanying grade-level objectives are specific descriptors of knowledge, skills and attitudes that when mastered will enable the student to attain the standard. The instructional objectives guide instructional planning and provide a basis for determining appropriate assessments, instructional strategies and resources. The performance descriptors provide the basis for assessing overall student competence of grade level standards. The performance descriptors define the five student performance levels ranging from novice to distinguished. With the ultimate goal of \"learning for all,\" these descriptors allow the teacher, students and parents to judge the level of student proficiency in each 21st century learning standard."

Emphasis will be placed on applying modeling as the process of choosing and using appropriate mathematics and statistics to analyze, to better understand, and to improve decisions in analyzing empirical situations. Collection and use of student-generated data should be an aspect of the course. Students will represent and process their reasoning and conclusions numerically, graphically, symbolically, and verbally. Students will be expected to use technology, including graphing calculators, computers, and data gathering equipment throughout the course. Teachers are responsible for including the eight Standards for Mathematical Practice found in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M). Advanced Topics and Modeling in Mathematics does not require Arkansas Department of Education approval."

Students explore more complex geometric situations and deepen their explanations of geometric relationships, moving towards formal mathematical arguments. Important differences exist between this Geometry course and the historical approach taken in Geometry classes. For example, transformations are emphasized early in this course. Close attention should be paid to the introductory content for the Geometry conceptual category found in the high school CCSS. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations."

The critical areas, called units, deepen and extend understanding of linear and exponential relationships by contrasting them with each other and by applying linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend, and students engage in methods for analyzing, solving, and using quadratic functions.

The four levels (basic, proficient, advanced, and exemplary) loosely correspond to the number of theatre courses a student has taken. Introduction to theatre is recommended at the Pre-K level. However, it is important to realize that in classroom application, the progression of benchmarks may apply over virtually any sequence of grades. Benchmarks at each level build upon those from previous levels, but do not replace them."

They are not intended to represent the full science curriculum at each grade span, but are meant to capture the \"major ideas\" of science that can be assessed in an on-demand setting. The goal is that the science GSEs focus the curriculum, but do not restrict it. The science GSEs are written for grade spans K-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and high school. They describe the science knowledge and abilities students should demonstrate at the end of each grade span. Since the large-scale high school science assessment is given near the end of grade 11, the GSEs for high school for all students are aligned with the content for the assessment."

The arts are essential to a basic education and the right of every student in New Mexico. To ensure arts education for all students, the curriculum should be delivered through the collaborative efforts of arts specialists and classroom teachers. At the state level, the New Mexico Content Standards and Benchmarks for the Arts are mandated for students in grades K-8. The Standards are required in the arts electives for participating students in grades 9-12, and the state does have a fine arts or practical arts graduation requirement. Arts and Entertainment has been included as one of seven career clusters endorsed by the Governor's office for students, K-12, to consider as they become aware of, explore, and experience a variety of career opportunities."

Students who select modern languages should be able to speak, read, write, and understand the foreign language they study; students who select a classical language should be able to read and understand the foreign language they study. In order to achieve these goals, it is recommended in this framework that students begin their language studies in the elementary grades and continue to study one or more languages throughout middle and high school."

As a means to self-discovery, students learn to make their own dances, created from their most beautiful thoughts. They become involved in various aspects of technical production and come to understand others by learning dances of their ancestors and friends in the community. The Dance section of the Mississippi Visual and Performing Arts Framework offers a program of study that is developmentally and sequentially balanced to assist with elementary, middle school, and high school dance curriculum development at the local and district level."

The standards were updated for all grades, K – 12, and were aligned to the 2007 National Health Education Standards. Early drafts of the updated standards were reviewed by teachers, community health educators and university health education faculty. The standards were also posted online for review by Indiana teachers, administrators, school nurses, parents, physicians and community members. In the final step, the updated standards were again reviewed by national content reviewers for content, rigor, specificity, and comprehensiveness."

            "The Next Generation Content Standards and Objectives for Social Studies in West Virginia Schools were revised by a committee of educators from across the state. The overarching goal was to build a rigorous, relevant, challenging and developmentally appropriate social studies curriculum that prepares students for college and career readiness. The West Virginia educators played a key role in shaping the content standards to align with national standards, rigorous national assessments, research and best practice in the field of social studies education. The contribution of these professionals was critical in creating a policy that is meaningful to classroom teachers and appears in a format that can easily be used and understood."

With Maryland's adoption of the Common Core standards, teachers in all subject areas will build discipline-specific literacy into daily instruction when and where appropriate. The disciplinary literacy standards are not meant to replace existing content standards in the history, social studies, science, or technical subject classrooms, but rather to support them. Literacy development is essential for students to access and learn disciplinary content and must be a shared responsibility across all fields of study."

            "Stagecraft I is a two-semester course which provides students with both exposure to and experience in all elements of technical theatre, including scenery, props, lighting, sound, costume, and makeup. The four strands emphasize creating, performing/presenting, responding and connecting. In Creating, students generate ideas and original tangible works. In Performing and Presenting, students perform tasks associated with technical theatre and present their work to others. Through Responding, students examine works already created by themselves, their peers, or others to analyze the artistic merit and refine work. Through Connecting, students discover connections between theatrical works and historical, societal, and cultural context. Stagecraft I contains foundational elements of theatre that are not developed in Stagecraft II and III, but the teacher may choose to draw student learning expectations from the Drama II-III Curriculum Framework. Stagecraft II is a two-semester course which allows students to advance their skills in all elements of technical theatre through practical experience, with new instruction in design. Stagecraft III is a two-semester course which allows students to deepen their understanding and advance their skills in specialized elements of technical theatre, which could include scenery, props, lighting, sound, costume, and/or makeup. Stagecraft I fulfills the one-half unit of fine arts credit required for graduation. Arkansas Department of Education approval is not required for Stagecraft I, Stagecraft II, or Stagecraft III."

Using this framework, skills are further expanded into a scope and sequence of grade level skills. However, the \"power\" of this information literacy model will be lost if skills are taught in isolation rather than as part of literacy learning and the research process across the curriculum.

            "Through legislative requirements of Act 180 (2007), the Louisiana Department of Education (LDOE) was given the responsibility to coordinate the development and implementation of health and physical education (PE) curricula in all public elementary and secondary schools. Also in 2007, coordinated school health stakeholders recommended the development of grade-level expectations (GLEs) for health and PE. GLEs have been developed for core content subjects to develop grade-by-grade standards to guide the development of curriculum, instruction, and assessment and to provide uniformity in subject content taught across Louisiana. Therefore, the Department of Education chose to develop GLEs to achieve the charge of developing curricula in health and PE."

Success in the 21st century differs significantly from the 20th-century model. Lifelong employment with a single employer has virtually vanished. Success today is increasingly dependent on a sophisticated knowledge base, the ability to enhance that base, collaborate, self-direct and adapt to change. Individuals will need to alter their goals and decisions over their lifetimes in relation to school and workplace requirements and personal responsibilities. As part of Career and Education Development, students must see education as a continuous lifelong process that will prepare them for and make them adaptable in a complex, information-rich and fast-changing world."

Cognition focuses on learning, memory, information processing, and language development. Personality and Assessment looks at the approaches used to explain one's personality and the assessment tools used. Abnormal Psychology explores psychological disorders and the various treatments used for them. Socio-Cultural Dimensions of Behavior covers topics such as conformity, obedience, perceptions, attitudes and influence of the group on the individual. Psychological Thinking explores how to think like a psychologist and expand critical thinking skills needed in the day-to-day life of a psychologist."

These big ideas are: Personal Wellness, Nutrition, Safety, Psychomotor Skills and Lifetime Physical Wellness. The Big Ideas are conceptual organizers for health and physical education and are the same at each grade level. This ensures students have multiple opportunities throughout their school careers to develop skills and concepts linked to the Big Ideas. Under each Big Idea are statements of Enduring Knowledge/Understandings that represent overarching generalizations linked to health and physical education. The understandings represent the desired results-what learning will focus upon and what knowledge students will be able to explain or apply. Understandings can be used to frame development of units of study and lessons plans. Skills and Concepts describe the ways that students demonstrate their learning and are specific to each grade level. The skills and concepts for health and physical education are fundamental to health literacy and build on prior learning."

Visual literacy permits students to become active initiators rather than passive receivers of information. Through the visual arts, students are provided an opportunity to discover, develop, and actualize their unique potential. The visual arts assist students in developing the many facets of multiple intelligences while providing meaningful learning opportunities and the development of critical and creative thinking. As students progress from elementary to high school, the visual arts become an important process of self-expression and provide an opportunity for students to focus on a particular art form along with like-minded peers, giving them a sense of belonging within the school community."

A select group of public and private school teacher-librarians/media specialists from around the state researched and studied the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) guidelines, library standards articulated by other states, and existing grade level library standards from various school districts both in and out of state. They went through a process of study, synthesis and writing, drawing on the professional and collective wisdom of experts in the area of K-12 library instruction, reading and technology use. Together, the committee identified four instructional areas necessary for a robust library program: Information Literacy; Reading Engagement; Social Responsibility and Technology Integration. On January 22, 2015, the State Board of Education voted unanimously to adopt the Oregon School Library Standards."

To ensure arts education for all students, the curriculum should be delivered through the collaborative efforts of arts specialists and classroom teachers. At the state level, the New Mexico Content Standards and Benchmarks for the Arts are mandated for students in grades K-8. The Standards are required in the arts electives for participating students in grades 9-12, and the state does have a fine arts or practical arts graduation requirement.

Students examine how the United States Constitution protects rights and provides the structure and functions of various levels of government. How the United States interacts with other nations and the government's role in world affairs will be examined. A focus on American interactions with other nations, and the government's role in world affairs, will also be included. Using primary and secondary resources, students articulate, evaluate, and defend positions on political issues. As a result, they will be able to explain the role of individuals and groups in government, politics, and civic activities and the need for civic and political engagement of citizens in the United States."

            "The goal of physical education is to develop physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to enjoy a lifetime of healthful physical activity. The Wyoming Physical Education Standards Committee recognizes that a physically literate individual: (a) has learned the skills necessary to perform a variety of physical activities; (b) is physically fit; (c) does participate regularly in physical activity; (d) knows the implications of and benefits from involvement in physical activities; and (e) values physical activity and its contribution to a healthful lifestyle. These five major areas of focus that define what students should know and be able to do in physical education are key ingredients of quality physical education programs. Standards, as determined by the Committee, integrate the essential content, processes, and skills that students will need to master to become lifelong movers."

The State Social Studies Standards Committee recognizes that social studies is the integrated study of the social sciences and humanities to promote civic competence. The mission of social studies is to help young people develop the ability to make informed and reasoned decisions as citizens of a culturally diverse, democratic society in an interdependent world. Students develop a core of knowledge and skills drawn from many academic disciplines, learn how to analyze their own and others' opinions on important issues, and become motivated to participate in civic and community life as active, informed citizens."

West Virginia educators, including regular classroom teachers, special education teachers, teachers representing higher education institutions, and informal science educators convened to revise the content standards and objectives; they played a key role in shaping the content standards to align with national standards and rigorous national assessments. The committees considered major advances in science, research from the American Association for Advancement in Science and the National Research Council, and their understanding of how students learn science as decisions were made regarding science content, science and engineering practices, cross-cutting concepts, the nature of science, science literacy and the sequencing of standards. The contribution of these professionals was critical in creating a policy that is meaningful to classroom teachers and appears in a format that can easily be understood and used."

            "The Kansas Model Curricular Standards for the Visual Arts are designed for all visual art students and educators whether experienced or in the preservice years of their teaching career. A range of benchmarks engages students in reaching their greatest potential in the visual arts. In all cases, students will learn life-skills including critical thinking, astute observation, viewing from multiple perspectives, higher order learning, and authentic problem-solving skills. The purpose of the standards is to assist teachers in developing local curriculum, carrying out appropriate instruction, and assessing students' progress. The Kansas Curricular Standards for Visual Arts are aligned with the National Standards for the Visual Arts. They are meant to guide rather than dictate the structure and development of art education programs in Kansas schools."

ITEA defines technological literacy as \"The ability to use, manage, understand, and assess technology.\" As evidenced in the final report of the Visionary Panel for Better Schools, teachers must have access to a precise and challenging curriculum, one that is uniform in content and expectations and fully aligned with state standards. Additionally, teachers must have the technical assistance and support they need to translate curriculum into effective, individualized instruction. The development of state the State Curriculum for Technology Education is our first step in meeting this goal."

Students learn to choose healthy foods through effective nutrition education. Teaching nutrition can improve students' eating habits, but students need consistent messages that build on skills already in place. Developing sound nutritional and exercise habits early in life will help children become healthy adults. This is one of the most important life skills that we can teach our students, and requires a comprehensive approach to be effective. Teachers can use the nutrition education standards as a framework to develop age-appropriate lessons that are consistent in scope and sequence."

Studio Art 3-D is a course in which students further explore,apply, and move toward mastery of the elements of art and principles of design in specific areas of art, such as ceramics, jewelry, mosaics, fiber arts, sculptures, mixed media, altered books, or other 3-D media. Student art will demonstrate evidence of complex problem-solving skills, higher order thinking, risk taking, imagination, and innovation. Students will exhibit art and will assemble portfolios that reflect personal growth in the media, techniques, process, and tools used to create complex 3-D compositions. Student compositions will cover a breadth of media and subject matter and will demonstrate successful completion of Studio Art 3-D student learning expectations. Art I is a prerequisite for this course. The Standards for Accreditation require a one-half unit course of survey of fine arts or one-half unit of an advanced art or advanced music course. Studio Art 3-D may be used to fulfill this requirement. Arkansas Department of Education approval is not required for Studio Art 3-D."

Students will learn that Earth is a dynamic system and Earth's atmosphere is a result of processes that took millions of years. The learner then takes this knowledge of the composition and characteristics of Earth's atmosphere, and transfers it to delve into the factors that can cause short term and long term changes in Earth's atmospheric conditions. Students will learn that the Earth is an interacting system of both energy and matter. To understand the interaction, students must build on prior knowledge of matter and the factors the affect its behavior. In addition, throughout this course students will use science inquiry skills, manipulation of appropriate lab equipment and demonstration of appropriate safety practice."

Students will compare the Earth's properties with those of the other planets and explore how the heavens have influenced human thought and action. The course gives a description of astronomical phenomena using the laws of physics. The course treats many standard topics including planets, stars, the Milky Way and other galaxies, black holes to more esoteric questions concerning the origin of the universe and its evolution and fate. Although largely descriptive, the course will occasionally require the use of sophomore-high level mathematics. Laboratory exercises include experiments in light properties, measurement of radiation from celestial sources, and observations at local observatories and/or planetariums"

They are not intended to represent the full curriculum for instruction and assessment locally, nor are they meant to simply replace existing social studies curriculum. The set of GSEs includes concepts and skills intended to be for local assessment purposes only.

            "Study in the arts is an essential means---not an end---to acquiring thinking skills, creativity, the ability to change, and the facility to teach oneself. In a safe, nurturing environment, the arts enable students to express their feelings, communicate thoughts, explore their creativity, solve problems, communicate ideas, develop a sense of community, and appreciate themselves as participants in history, tradition, and culture. Learning in art, dance, drama, film, and music advances and strengthens motor skills, promotes considerate behavior, ability to work well with others, self discipline, perception, and sensitivity. Fine Arts experiences contribute to the developmental process of understanding one another and naturally motivate students in all their learning."

Students will critically review literature on their chosen research problem, design and conduct a long-term study, and report the results. Students will participate in on-going peer reviews that will help students refine their research protocol, analysis, and conclusions. There will be two culminating evaluative processes. First, students will present their findings at a \"board review\" at the local school, before teachers, parents, and a panel of \"science experts.\" Second, students will present their research in one of several formats such as the following: at a regional or national meeting; as part of regional or national competition, e.g., Science and Engineering Fair, FIRST Robotics, or selected Science Olympiad events; or state, regional, or national publication."

Studio Art 2-D is a course in which students further explore, apply, and move toward mastery of the elements of art and principles of design in specific areas of art, such as painting, drawing, printmaking, digital art, photography, mixed media, surface design, or other 2-D media. Student art will demonstrate evidence of complex problem-solving skills, higher order thinking, risk taking, imagination, and innovation. Students will exhibit art and will assemble portfolios that reflect personal growth in media, techniques, processes, and tools used to create complex 2-D compositions. Student compositions will cover a breadth of media and subject matter and will demonstrate successful completion of Studio Art 2-D student learning expectations. The Standards for Accreditation require schools to offer a one-half unit course of Survey of Fine Arts or one-half unit of an advanced art or advanced music course. Studio Art 2-D may be used to fulfill this requirement. Arkansas Department of Education approval is not required for Studio Art 2-D."

            "The GLEs provide a grade-by-grade sequence of concepts, regional areas and chronological periods based on the framework of the EALRs and their components. Local school districts are not required to follow this exact sequence; districts can reorder them within grade bands (i.e., 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12). However districts are encouraged to consider the mobility of their students and the advantages of following the recommended sequence to ensure that their students have equitable access to all of the skills that build a strong social studies background. The goal of the GLEs is to help teachers and local districts design the scope and sequence of their social studies programs, and to develop lessons and instruction that ensure all students have an opportunity to master the skills and standards the EALRs and GLEs describe."

            "Throughout the ages the arts have been used to express happiness, sorrow, love, and many other very real human emotions. The arts are often asked to express that which cannot be expressed through words. The Priority Academic Student Skills (PASS) suggest benchmarks in the understanding of the arts for all students. Why is it important for each student to understand the significance of the arts in a historical, cultural, or aesthetic sense? Should students be encouraged to create meaningful, interpretive, original, or creative expressions? Will meaningful arts instruction give students the confidence they need to explore and create at the very highest of educational standards? Anthropologists have found evidence of the use of art for purposes of discussion as early as 70,000 years ago. The arts that are created today will one day be our contribution to this ongoing discussion of the human experience."

Ultimately, students will make artistic decisions using multiple forms of inspiration, particularly focusing on social, cultural, and historical context.

In Theatre II and III students will focus on the practical application of skills developed in Theatre I. Students will take on more complex projects and may begin to develop directorial skills. Ultimately, students will make artistic decisions using multiple forms of inspiration, particularly focusing on social, cultural, and historical context. Theatre I contains an introduction to stagecraft skills. Theatre II and III do not develop these stagecraft skills, but the teacher may choose to draw student learning expectations from the Stagecraft I-III Curriculum Framework.

            "Theatre is unique because it borrows its content from other disciplines and then applies it to an expressive, aesthetic form. Some may look at these standards and point out they are performance standards, not true content standards. However, the pure content of theatre is what is taught in history, language arts, science, and mathematics. What is unique to theatre is its active form. The standards also teach broader learning concepts. The skills of critical thinking, problem-solving, working with others, communication skills, and decision making are integral to every element of theatre and carry over into all of the other subject areas. Recent studies have shown that students who participate in the arts, especially theatre, do better academically, and are more successful in their career endeavors, than those who do not."

This course emphasizes a multi-representational approach to Calculus, with concepts, results, and problems being expressed graphically, numerically, symbolically, analytically, and verbally through the use of unifying themes of derivatives, integrals, limits, application and modeling, and approximation. Teachers are responsible for including the eight Standards for Mathematical Practice found in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M). Calculus does not require Arkansas Department of Education approval."

            "The fundamental purpose of this course is to formalize and extend the mathematics that students learned in the middle grades. Because it is built on the middle grades standards, this is a more ambitious version of Algebra I than has generally been offered. The critical areas, called units, deepen and extend understanding of linear and exponential relationships by contrasting them with each other and by applying linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend, and students engage in methods for analyzing, solving, and using quadratic functions. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations."

Grade 7 Social Studies provides a study of both physical and human geography of the world through a geographic lens. As students study the continents and regions across the globe, they will learn about the historic, cultural, economic, and political development as well as interconnections that occur in both human and physical systems of each area. During this study, students will develop the perspective of a global citizen, understanding that global-scale issues and problems are resolved through extensive collaboration among the world's peoples, nations, and economic organizations. Geographic inquiry helps students understand and appreciate their own place in the world and fosters curiosity about Earth's wide diversity of environments and cultures. Geography requires using spatial and environmental perspectives, asking and answering questions about global interconnections and spatial patterns, and applying geographic skills and tools. Creating maps and other geographic representations promotes the inquiry process and can be useful in making decisions and solving problems. This course helps students understand that thinking geographically requires knowing that the world is a set of complex ecosystems interacting at multiple scales that structure the spatial patterns and processes influencing our daily lives."

The Standards are required in the arts electives for participating students in grades 9-12, and the state does have a fine arts or practical arts graduation requirement. Arts and Entertainment has been included as one of seven career clusters endorsed by the Governor's office for students, K-12, to consider as they become aware of, explore, and experience a variety of career opportunities."

Health education in schools can effectively enable students to develop the knowledge and skills they need to reduce health risks, while simultaneously enhancing their academic achievement. Positive health behaviors initiated early in life should decrease the possibility of disease, disability, and premature death later in life. Far too many young people die in the District of Columbia because of unintentional injuries or as the result of violent behavior. Too many others compromise their well-being through unhealthy behaviors, such as using alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs. Comprehensive health education will equip our students with the knowledge and skills they need to advance personal, family, school, and community health."

Each standard is an overarching statement of content, to which we have attached multiple age-appropriate benchmarks as a means of evaluating students' mastery. To make the standards as accessible as possible, they have been designed to apply to all socioeconomic student groups. The standards do not assume prior economic or financial knowledge and are written in deliberately nontechnical language so that they can be taught by teachers who are not trained in personal finance and economics."

In a context of meaningful content, on-going assessment, and focused explicit instruction, students will evaluate literary and informational texts and multicultural literature of diverse formats (e.g., print media, Web-based texts, literary and informational books and articles) and genres. In addition, students will engage in learning events tied to a variety of literary and informational texts with increasing complexity. Additionally, students will demonstrate competencies through purposeful applications based on individual and collective literacy goals. Critical Reading does not require Arkansas Department of Education approval."

            "Theatre is one of the four programs of study from which an elective course may be chosen to fulfill the graduation requirement of one course in the arts. Theatre electives must be offered to accommodate at least one level of student achievement (Theatre I). Electives must be provided to accommodate four sequential levels of student achievement (Theatre I - IV). The number of class periods for which theatre is offered will depend upon enrollment and the availability of space for acting, constructing costumes, scenery, and properties. Theatre classes provide opportunities for both individual and group projects. For this reason, students working at two, three, or four different achievement levels may be accommodated in a single class if the enrollment is small. The instructional objectives provided in the following pages describe four sequential levels of student achievement."

            "Dance is a means of communication and self-expression different from the written or spoken word, or from visual and auditory symbol systems. Dance is a performing art ideally taught sequentially with each level reinforcing and building upon skills taught at previous levels. Dance education is a study of \"the art of dance\" as well as the techniques involved in the various styles. As students learn and share dances from their own communities and other cultures, they gain skills and knowledge that will prepare them to become responsive participants in an increasingly global society, with a better understanding of dance from a recreational or vocational viewpoint. Each level of dance provides opportunities to correlate dance activities with other subjects thereby enriching learning."

The study of Environment and Ecology will allow students to be active participants and problem solvers in real issues that affect them, their homes, schools and communities. The very interdisciplinary nature of this field allows teachers and students to use science, technology and social systems as the vehicles to a better tomorrow through the Environment and Ecology Standards. With the addition of PreK-3 Environment and Ecology Standards, it is suggested that Grade 1 focus on terrestrial habitats; Grade 2 focus on aquatic habitats; and Grade 3 focus on wetland habitats."

They are organized in grade level clusters of K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12, and they are composed of three overarching themes: Physical Education Literacy, Physical Activity and Fitness, and Responsible Physical Activity Behavior. Within each of these themes are two unique topic strands for a total of six topic strands. These strands are aligned to the National Standards for Physical Education and are articulated throughout the Physical Education Essential Learnings. The overarching themes and topic strands are identified to help organize the essential learnings. Within each strand are one or more essential learnings reflecting what students should know and be able to do at the end of each grade level range (e.g., K-2)."

The committee structured the standards in a way so that any grade level/content area could pursue a goal of proficiency for their students. The idea being that students in the fourth grade could reach a level of proficiency in acting appropriate to their grade level, while students in the ninth grade could reach proficiency in acting appropriate to their grade level. Additionally, theatre standards are written and organized in a way that both theatre and non-theatre educators can access, integrate, and utilize them in a variety of instructional settings."

            "This course would emphasize, in greater depth, 10-15 key turning points in American History. These turning points would be \"hinge\" events in our nation's history, caused by, and subsequently contributing to, major social, cultural, political, and/or economic events. Turning points chosen for this course do not need to be events that have been popularly discussed in the standard United States History survey course. They should be \"off-centered\" to allow students an opportunity to study, in depth, a potentially fresh topic in United States History. Thus, the Mexican War could be a turning point of emphasis, instead of a better known war, such as the Civil War."

            "The course should accentuate the history, struggles, successes and similarities of diverse groups of twentieth-century Americans who protested on behalf of civil liberties and civil rights. The course should begin with an understanding of America's founding documents—The Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution—and the conceptual and historical paradoxes of each. A foundation of the course should be an understanding of Jefferson's creed that \"...all men are created equal...,\" as well as, the document's interpretation and applicability over the course of the Twentieth Century. The course should also emphasize the flexibility of the U.S. Constitution, and specifically the impact of additional amendments over time and their varying interpretations on both civil liberties and civil rights during the Twentieth Century. The thrust of the course should be the historical narrative of a people who persevered to give greater meaning to our founding creed and those founding American documents. This story would include the twentieth century social movements for greater freedom and equality led by and for various groups of Americans. Because of past and current global calls for universal human rights based on Jefferson's ideals, this course should promote the interconnected civil liberties and civil rights narrative of a people, a nation, and a world."

Subsequently, the direct and indirect battles associated with this post World War II ideological conflict with the former Soviet Union have had lasting effects on our nation, our relationships with other people, and the world. The relevant lessons of the Cold War would help promote informed judgments by contemporary American citizens."

Globalization is the ongoing process of increasing interconnectedness and interdependence among humankind. While its origins are debatable, this process has been significantly amplified with the onset of new communication technologies that have improved economic, political, social, cultural, historic, and geographic connections among individuals, groups, and nations. The mounting flow of goods, services, finances, ideas, and people across national and international borders has created a world ever more devoid of physical and political boundaries and dependent upon empathy and collaboration. Since the consequences of the process are not predetermined, an awareness of the positive or negative possibilities of these connections is paramount to individual improvement and the advancement of humanity."

The goal of this course is to broaden the knowledge and understandings of students interested in learning about the histories, cultures, legacies and achievements of American Indians from prehistoric to present-day societies. The course offers traditional and contemporary perspectives, which place the land, its history, and the people at the center. The course will emphasize interactions between and within American Indian groups as well as with the government of the United States. The course draws upon concepts and issues of policy, law, economic and cultural change as well as shared beliefs concerning human-environment interaction. Students will be able to immerse themselves in some of America's oldest continuous societies and cultures, within a learning environment which fosters open, critical and creative historical thought. Although the many American Indian groups of North Carolina are encouraged to be used as the focus of instructional content examples, the expectation of the course is to expose students to American Indian societies and tribes from all areas of the United States throughout history."

In addition, they correlate structurally to the three arts processes defined in the 2008 NAEP Arts Education Assessment Framework: creating, performing, and responding. When actively engaged in these processes, students not only learn about the arts, they learn through and within the arts. The NCCAS National Arts Standards have four clusters (Create, Present, Respond & Connect) as their focal points. This difference will be reconciled in future iterations of New Jersey's Core Curriculum Content standards in Visual and Performing Arts."

Through artful planning and teaching of age-appropriate musical experiences, students from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade can be the recipients of the joys inherent in music. Observing a child engrossed in a meaningful musical experience visually documents the power of music. The joy shining from the eyes, the bodies moving to the rhythms, the obvious pleasure glowing from the faces are all signs of the emotional power music can provide."

The economic, social and political well-being of our state depends on the well-being of Pennsylvania's families. The family is responsible for nurturing its members. Family experiences, to a great extent, determine who a person is and what a person becomes. Family and Consumer Sciences, working with Pennsylvania's families, supports the development of the knowledge and skills that students need as family members both now and in the future. The 21st Century requires students to develop the ability to transform information into knowledge by using standards to certify that this information is meaningful, categorizing it to a purpose and then transforming their knowledge into wisdom by applying it to real life."

A health literate person is able to make appropriate decisions about their health as he or she progresses through life, as health care changes, and as societal norms change. The benefits of being health literate influence the full range of life's activities—home, school, work, society and culture (Zarcadoolas, 2005)."

These decisions often lead to habits that stay with them throughout life. The Health Education and Physical Education Standards will guide instruction that will help students make better decisions about their health. Through achievement of the Health Education and Physical Education Standards, students learn that their decisions can affect their health and set a pattern for their lives. Students also learn to protect their health by acquiring good information, by seeking good advice and friendships, and by taking responsibility for their own wellness which contributes to a healthy, active, balanced approach to life."

            "Kansas' schools have a long history of providing physical education to students. Most school districts provide a very comprehensive physical education program, K-12. Research has shown that planned, sequential instruction in physical education promotes lifelong physical activity. A comprehensive physical education program is designed to develop basic movement skills, sports skills, and physical fitness as well as to enhance mental, social and emotional activities. Further research has shown that physical activity among adolescents is consistently related to higher levels of self-esteem and lower levels of anxiety and stress. Physical activity is also positively associated with academic performance. Students who participate in school physical education programs do not experience any harmful effects on their standardized test scores, though less time is available for other academic subjects."

The topics of economics and personal finance teach that resources are limited; thus, people must make choices that may include substitutions or alternatives. Students practice using a set of tools for analyzing choices of all types, including those related to personal finance. Students learn the benefits of compound interest over time and that poor money management can lead to difficulty in obtaining credit. Students practice weighing costs and benefits of options when making choices about such things as careers, insurance, housing, investments, savings, automobiles and health care. Students practice these skills as they extend their understanding of the essential knowledge defined by the Standards of Learning for Economics and Personal Finance."

Young children live in a society where information is constantly changing and the ability to function well in an increasingly global economy is essential. Children must have the ability to continuously learn. Therefore, it is essential that children develop skills which allow them to become competent, independent learners capable of higher intellectual functions. To fulfill this role, teachers of young children must also be lifelong learners, continuously building their professional knowledge and functional competencies based on current research."

            "The Career Development Framework is a tool for state, regional, and local curriculum planning. This tool can be used as a means to assess the integration of career development within the existing curriculum as well as the overall career development of individuals. In many school districts, individual career development assessments will contribute to and culminate in a Competency Based Transcript, reflecting an individual's learning and progress. This framework will be used at the local level as a guide for making decisions about the design of curriculum, the delivery of instruction, and the development of classroom, school and district assessments. Educators, school board members, and citizens are encouraged to work cooperatively to develop local career education programs. The overall approach used should be cumulative, with learnings at each grade level providing the foundation for future learning and development in the areas of career awareness, experience, and planning. In summary, this framework is designed to be used as a systematic guide for integrating the processes of career development within local school districts' overall curriculum plans."

It links health education to other education reform efforts which seek to improve teaching and learning and contribute to high levels of achievement for all students. This framework does not take the place of, or in any way diminish, the legal health education requirements each school district must meet. Rather it offers a lens through which we can better focus on the teaching and learning of health that will carry our children into the next century. The seven Rhode Island standards for health education state what all Rhode Island students should know and be able to do as a result of K - 12 health education. The performance descriptions elaborating the standards suggest how students at various grade levels can demonstrate movement along the continuum to the eventual achievement of each standard. These descriptions do not preclude the development of additional and/or alternative performance descriptions at the district, building or class level."

Schools should encourage students to use creative and critical thinking skills, which are transferrable from the classroom to the workplace and to the community. In the schools, these workplace skills must build upon the basic skills, higher order thinking, and the practice of personal qualities that emphasize such things as respect and responsibility. Also, these workplace skills need to be taught and understood in an environment that accurately represents the realities of today's workplace."

            "The visual arts standards help educators to teach their students how to think like a \"genius.\" They provide inherent conceptual frameworks that are integral to higher-order thinking, expression, and experience. These discernments are intrinsic to the promotion, nurture and development of divergence in thought making and processing because they kindle the brain functions that spark innovation. When artists engage in the cognitive and experiential maneuvers provided by the visual arts, they are able to transform, reorganize, and transfer understanding into personal renderings and interpretations of the world around them. Verbal, logical, and number-sense brain functions are enhanced and accentuated by arts experiences, making the arts the \"genius\" centers for learning in the human brain. Contemporary brain research supports the notion of \"genius\" generated by arts experiences because of their direct impact on activating these brain functions."

            "The purpose of dance education in preschool through high school is to broadly educate all students in dance as an art form and to promote physical activity for fitness. Students demonstrate competence and confidence in a variety of genres and styles. They perform across cultural and professional boundaries. They communicate and inspire. They take responsibility and show initiative at the expected moment. Investigating the meanings and significance of the works of artists, choreographers, and technicians across time and space provides for the examination of ideas across disciplines. Students connect the concepts of dance to history, science, politics, religion, literature, drama, music, visual arts, and physical fitness. Dance can provide connections with any subject matter and help students to understand concepts important in other disciplines. Analyzing and critiquing dances — past and present — supports understanding of the relevance of the work in its time and culture."

In congruence with the other Georgia Performance Standards, the dance standards and elements will provide the basis from which sample tasks, student work, and teacher commentary can be developed. The standards are separated by their individual grade levels from kindergarten to grade five. The middle school grades (6-8) are banded, yet delineated by proficient and advanced levels. High school standards are delineated as Dance 1, Dance 2, Dance 3, and Dance 4. This design provides flexibility for dance teachers so that they may differentiate instruction within any given class or grade based on a student's prior experiences with dance. It also enables flexibility for the variety of class schedules found in high schools and the mixed grades that occur within the study of dance."

The 'story' of animals is told through evolutionary patterns across deep spans of time. Thus, the focus of this course is the recognition of key features of the major body plans that have evolved in animals and how those body plans have changed over time resulting in the diversity of animals that are evident today."

They cover basic learning expectations including knowledge, skills, communication, thinking, understanding, and innovation. The first three commonalties (knowledge, skills, and communication) are most easily assessed with standardized tests. They are also easier to teach through direct instruction, rote learning, training, and guided practice. Because they are easier to teach and assess, they often make up the bulk of instruction in schools. The remaining three commonalties (thinking, understanding, and innovation) are not as easily assessed through standard measures and are not as easy to teach through direct instruction. Despite these challenges, many believe these areas are equally important components of a complete education."

The great architects of American public education, such as Thomas Jefferson, Horace Mann, and John Dewey, believed that every student must be well versed in our nation's history, the principles and practices which undergird citizenship, and the institutions that define our government. Understandings of commerce and geography were critical to their thinking as well. In essence, Jefferson, Mann, and Dewey viewed the study of social studies as critical to the mission of public schools. Indeed, they would applaud the inclusion of a \"responsible and involved citizen\" in the Guiding Principles, as well as social studies as one of eight content areas in the Learning Results."
